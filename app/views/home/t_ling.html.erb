            <p class="essay-title">Theme: Please describe how you have prepared for your intended major​,
              including your readiness to succeed in your upper-division courses
              once you enroll at the university.</p>
              <p>Before attending college, I
              have been interested in Language and the society people livein for
              a long time. I want to know where languages originate from, how they
              have developed,and how important they are to the world. My middle school was an affiliated school to a famous
university, so I was able to enter the university’s library, in which I read a lot of books and
articles related to Languages and human. I also joined a pronunciation club to practice my
speaking skills, because I thought being able to pronounce clearly and correctly helps me
understand every part of the language better. I was, and am, determined to dedicate my life to
Linguistics and Anthropology.
After attending college, I was very excited to know that my school offers anthropology
classes, and I signed up quickly. By now, I have already finished physical and cultural
anthropology, and have experienced several kinds of field work. I went to interview other people
and set up exhibition boards to tell others what I have discovered in specific given topics. These
basic fieldworks gave me an overview of what I will be doing in the upper level classes. I am
currently taking linguistics anthropology and sociology, and I will take Linguistics and archeology
in the next quarter. I believe that all these classes can lead me to be well prepared for my future
study.
Besides, I have also learned two foreign languages, both before and after I entered
college. I believe that when interviewing others for my fieldwork, communicating with them in
their native languages makes them feel more comfortable and I can get their precise meaning,
which are much better than using a language that is not their native tongue. Moreover, being
able to understand more languages mean that I have more opportunities and am able to get
information from academic works in different languages.Therefore, I think I am well prepared for
my intended major. I am ready and looking forward to learn more about the field I love after I
transfer.</p>
